		<h3>Hi.</h3>
		<p>I am Trancwolve, and you are looking at my little website thing. Here you can find all the <a href="#links">links</a> to all of my stuff on all possible platforms. It's probably not the most professional website ever, but it does the job.</p>
		<h3>Who is this guy anyway?</h3>
		<p>Self-taught trance producer from Hungary, formerly known as <i>Steve Pixus</i>. Free software enthusiast (I use Arch btw), hardcore <a href="https://lmms.io">LMMS</a> user, and certified lone wolf. The meaning of the name is a not totally clear, but it's somewhere between <i>"to transform and evolve"</i> and <i>"a wolfy who makes trance UwU"</i>.

		<h3>What I do/have done</h3>
		<p>The main direction is trance and sometimes some uncategorizably crazy stuff.</p>
		<p>My first album titled <i>Dark Matters</i> was released under the name <i>DJ Pixus</i>, and it was basically a one-hour mix of some of my early works. You can still listen to parts of it, thanks to some "No Copyright" re-uploaders.</p>
		<p>For a couple of years I released all of my stuff as <i>Steve Pixus</i>, and my soon released album called Tranc Musicc (yes, that's the actual title) contains mostly trance tracks from that time.</p>
		<p>Currently my main focus is the <i>Trancwolve</i> project, but I still use the old name for "other things".</p>
		<h3>Licensing</h3>
		<p>All of my <i>original</i> musicc is released under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">Creative Commons BY-SA</a> and is available for free in lossless format. You might even get some of the source files if you ask nicely.</p>
		<p>If you want to use my musicc in your YouTube videos, you are free to do so as long as you are not presenting it as your own work. Otherwise, I'm gonna find your house and eat you.</p>
		<p>I do NOT and will NEVER release stuff on Spotify or such services. If you ever run into my stuff being sold for money, that's someone else...</p>
